> We must cultivate our garden.
- Volatire (Candide)

  This is the closing sentence in Volatire's Satire Candide. Of course the metaphorical sense is, regardless of what's happening in the world
  we should continue to work on ourselves and shouldn't worry too much in things which are either inconsequential or are out of our controls. This
  doesn't mean we become ignorant or indifferent towards those but rather put oneself and one's concerns first. I love the literal meaning too,
  just cultivate your gardens.


  I spent a weekend cataloguing all the flowers and plants me and my brother have grown in our little garden. It's him really who got me
  interested in gardening and the beauty of it. The planning (timing) of when to plant what and where (sunlight, water, moist etc) and the patience
  it requires to see them come of age: all of these give me a lot of solace and peace.

lucky us it survived)

### Morning Glory
(We got this from the banks of Bijapur River in Pokhara. It has spread so quickly, these flowers bloom in all glory in the morning and slowly
wither away in the evening only to awake the next morning. It's so fascinating)
![IMG_3781 HEIC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bee76f9-4772-42e8-a004-46021ab15685)

### Bergenia (Elephant's ears) (Nepali Name: Pakhane पखने )
We got this during our hike to Annapurna Base Camp. It has medicinal usage. (that's how we got to know about the plant from the stories
shared by our mother). It's less likely that it will survive here in Pokhara (it's a bit tropical for this) but let's see

### Hibiscus (Red)
We have a lot of varieties of this. (Red, White, Pink)
Have never tried hibiscus tea so far but have used it to shampoo my hair.

### Red Max Wallow
We called this (Chilli flower - as it resembles a red chilli) during our childhood. It has sweet nectar (that's plenty in quantity). 
Loved it as a kid and still do and eat the nectar, hahaha

### Peepal Bonsai
Peepal has a religious/spiritual significance in Hindu community. My brother has been growing this in Bonsai Fashion as we don't have
lot of space. (Naturally it can grow to be huge with it's roots penetrating deep and wide)

### Balloonplant/hairy-balls/bishop's-balls :D

### White Lily on a DIY aquarium
- In that aquarium we have zebra fishes. Zebra fishes were brought from Bijaypur River and the peace lilies and various small aquatic plants
  were brought from Begnas and Fewa Lake. It's a miniature Pond Ecosystem really!! (Not to worry about mosquitoes laying eggs there because
  zebra fishes are there to devour and we change water once in a while)
