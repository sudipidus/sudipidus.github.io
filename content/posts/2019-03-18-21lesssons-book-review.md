My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2558756392">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
We live in an extremely complicated world. It's so difficult to make sense even of the tiniest realm of our lives. Religious dogma, political gambles, economic disparity, an ever-increasing gap between poor and rich, promises and dangers of new technologies like Machine learning and artificial intelligence form the most confusing crossroad in all of the recorded human histories so far.<br /><br />This book touches almost all the topics of concern in today's life. Writer's honesty shows up when he carefully examines all the 'religious stories' including Judaism. It covers in a huge breadth for topics ranging from religion to technology. It's certainly a thought-provoking and an insightful book which I would recommend.<br /><br />
