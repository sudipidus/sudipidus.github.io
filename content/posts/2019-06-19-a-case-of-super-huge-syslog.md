title: Curious Case of super huge syslog

**The Problem:**

Insufficient memory left on /root partition.

On inspection I found that it was happening because ```/var/log``` was growing till 35 GB (I have a root partition of 50 GB). 

On further inspection I found that ```/var/log/syslog``` was huge


Following was the repeating line (error log that would quickly fill up my disk space)

```

```


**Reason**

I use sdkman to manage my java/gradle (and other JVM based languages) installation and management.

```sdkman-init.sh #source script to initialize sdkman``` 

Sourcing of this script had to be inside .zshrc (was in .bashrc but I was using zsh)
