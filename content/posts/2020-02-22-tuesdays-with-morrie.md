I loved the narration.

I loved the content and the insights this book provides in addition to the beautifully crafted chapters. Almost every page gets you into a contemplative mode of introspection about life, love and the 'culture'.

The biggest take away for me from this book is this:

Culture is a man-made thing and is presented in such a way that people tend to conform to it. In today's modern age of information and social media, this is even truer. We have some defined ideas of what love is, what beauty is, how one should live his/her life and so on. One of the triumphs of us human being would be to disregard that culture if that comes in our way of happiness and purpose.

Morrie was a punk!!

I Also loved the fact that the portion of this book's royalty was used for his treatment in his dying days.
This is the greatest tribute a student could offer to his teacher.
