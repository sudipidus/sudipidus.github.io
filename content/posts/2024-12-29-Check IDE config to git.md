title: check IDE config to git

### What's in your .gitignore?

It's become almost a convention to git ignore all the IDE specific files. Rationale being:
- it's not really the part of the codebase
- people can have different preferences of what IDE to use
- these configuration files can be [[Bloated Git Objects]]

#### Debunking These

- Although IDE configurations can indeed be bulky, we can cherry-pick the select few configurationsâ€”especially the ones pertaining to run and debug setups. Those are pretty light and don't change frequently.
- People have different preferences of IDE, but realistically (especially in professional settings) the options are just a handful. Committing these configs can hugely help in getting new team members up to speed.
- Technically, the configurations aren't part of the codebase, but they're a great supplement for the setup and can encode valuable project knowledge.

### Why You Should Commit IDE Configurations

- **Faster Onboarding:** New developers can run and debug the project with a single click, without having to reverse-engineer the setup.
- **Consistency:** Everyone runs the same commands and scripts, reducing "works on my machine" issues.
- **Documentation:** Run/debug configs serve as living documentation for how to start, test, and deploy the app.
- **Best Practices:** You can encode recommended workflows (e.g., test before commit, run linter, etc.) directly into the IDE.

### What to Commit

- Run/debug configurations for common tasks (start app, run tests, migrations, etc.)
- Shared code style and formatting settings
- Workspace/project settings that benefit the whole team

### What to Ignore

- User-specific settings (window layout, recent files, personal preferences)
- Local history, caches, and logs

Most modern IDEs (IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.) allow you to separate user and project settings. Check their docs for which files are safe and useful to commit.

### Conclusion

Don't blindly ignore all IDE files. Be intentional: commit the configs that help your team, and ignore the rest. Your future teammates (and your future self) will thank you.
