## Demonstration by Example

[This was originally answered by me at Quora](https://qr.ae/TW73hg)

```bash
#!/bin/sh
sleep 50
```
let’s save it as a.sh and make it executable
```bash
sudo chmod +x a.sh
```
Let's run it in the background and stat the process.
```bash
./a.sh&
[1] 11660
```
On looking at the process details:

```bash
 ps -fp 11660
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
sudipbh+ 11660 11330  0 15:30 pts/7    00:00:00 /bin/sh ./a.sh
```

We can see that the content of the file is passed as an argument to the program /bin/sh.

In Bash scripting, this enables the script author to mention the exact interpreter to be used by the program and if it’s not found the user can take it as a cue to install the required interpreter.

The same idea would be extended to other interpreted languages like python.
