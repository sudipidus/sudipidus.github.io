### Literate Programming

Python notebooks are so ubiquitous in the Machine learning community. All the cloud providers have dedicated services to run these notebooks: [Jupyter on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/jupyter/), [Jupyter on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks?view=azureml-api-2), and [Google](https://colab.research.google.com/)[ Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/). These are popular largely because of how we can accommodate both code and instructional text in the same file. With each individual cell as an executable code block or a properly formatted markdown text, this makes it much easier to present information, document the information and make it a better educational material. 

This style of programming interspersed with code and natural language is literate programming. It was first conceptualized by Donald Knuth. (Jupyter Notebook style of programming is a subset of the original concept).


Although Jupyter started out to support (Julia, Python and R -> which makes up the word Jupyter), there are a lot of jupyter kernels nowadays that allow us to make notebooks for other languages too.

One thing that I often like to do is find out the kernel for the language that I am using and keep a scratch book of sorts as a jupyter notebook. This works as a quick lookup and a refresher for me. 

Here is one such case where I am using [gophernotes](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes) as a go kernel for jupyter notebook.
