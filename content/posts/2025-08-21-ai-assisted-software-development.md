AI and LLMs: Useful, But More Code Isn’t Always the Solution

The rise of AI and large language models (LLMs) has made writing code easier and more accessible than ever before. With a few prompts, developers can generate boilerplate, automate repetitive tasks, and even solve complex problems. This is a remarkable leap in productivity and creativity.

However, it’s important to remember that code itself is not the solution—at least, not always. As these tools make it easier to write more code, there’s a real risk that we end up creating more complexity, more dependencies, and ultimately, more problems.

Every new line of code is a potential source of bugs, maintenance overhead, and technical debt. The temptation to solve every problem by adding more code can lead to bloated systems that are harder to understand and evolve. AI can help us write code, but it can’t (yet) make the hard decisions about what *should* be built, or how to keep things simple.

The real challenge is not just in writing code, but in knowing when *not* to write it. Simplicity, clarity, and thoughtful design are more important than ever. As we embrace AI-assisted development, let’s remember that less code—done well—often leads to better outcomes than more code, no matter how quickly it’s written.
